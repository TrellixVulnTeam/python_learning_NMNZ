# Python Learning

## Introduction

This is the repository I want to write down the code and difficult I face  when I learn python.

## 01 Procedure Oriented

In this file, it talk about all of the python basic.

#### 1.1 Basic

* Basic grammer for python.

#### 1.2 Branch

* if, elif and else are the keyword for branch.

#### 1.3 Loop

* While loop is a type of loop which can run typical code for several time.

#### 1.4 Function

* Def is the key word to define a function in python.

#### 1.5 Module

* Every .py file is a module and we can use import to use the function of other module.

#### 1.6 List and Tuple

* LIst and Tuple are two data type of python
* They are ordered and list can be change and tuple can not
* There are many function for list and only two for tuple which is index and count.

#### 1.7 Dictionary

* Dictionary is one data type of python
* It has key and value. Key and value are in pair. Dictionary is inordered.

#### 1.8 String

* String is one data type of python. There are many functions for String.

#### 1.9 For

* For each is a typical type of for loop, the code inside the each will occur if the for loop finish without break.

#### 1.10 [Project] Name Card System

* This is a Name Card System which can add, show and search the cards.





## 02 Object Oriented Programming(OOP)

In this file, it talk about all of the python OOP.

#### 2.1 OOP basic grammer

* Create first class üê± 
* when create the second üò∫ , their addresses are different
* parameter "self" inside function points to the Class itself
* use parameters to specify the attribute of an object
* \_\_init\_\_, When the object made, init autoly run
* \_\_del\_\_, When object go, del autoly run
* \_\_str\_\_, return specified output of print(Object)

#### 2.2 Encapsulation (One feature of OOP)

* Two objects do not affect each other
* The attribute of an object can be another object
* Python do not have real private, we can add "object.\_class\_\_attr" or "object.\_class\_\_func()" to get the private func and attr **NOT RECOMMEND**

#### 2.3 Inheritance (One feature of OOP)

* Child  class and Grandchild class can inherit all function from Father class
* When the function of father is not good enough , overide that
* Use super() to get the function of father class
* Use father.func(self) **Python 2.x Not recommend**
* Child can not get the private attr and private func of its father
* Child can get the private attr and private func by the public func of its father
